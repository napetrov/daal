mrg32k3a
========

The engine is based on a 32-bit combined multiple recursive generator
with two components of order 3, optimized for batch processing.

.. rubric:: Subsequence selection methods support

skipAhead (nskip)
    Supported
leapfrog (threadIdx, nThreads)
    Supported

Batch Processing
****************

MRG32k3a engine needs the initial condition (``seed``) for state initialization.
The seed can be either an integer scalar or a vector of :math:`p` integer elements, the inputs to the respective engine constructors.

.. rubric:: Algorithm Parameters

MRG32k3a engine has the following parameters:

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.6}|

   * - Parameter
     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - ``algorithmFPType``
     - ``float``
     - The floating-point type that the algorithm uses for intermediate computations. Can be ``float`` or ``double``.
   * - ``method``
     - ``defaultDense``
     - Performance-oriented computation method; the only method supported by the algorithm.
   * - ``seed``
     -
       - :math:`777` for a scalar seed
       - NA for a vector seed
     - Initial condition for state initialization, scalar or vector:

       - Scalar, value of ``size_t`` type
       - Vector, pointer to ``HomogenNumericTable`` of size :math:`1 \times p`
