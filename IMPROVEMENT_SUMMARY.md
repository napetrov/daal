## üéØ **PR Review Enhancement Results**

### Before Improvements
- Generic instructions without clear focus
- Unclear build system priorities
- Verbose examples slowing review process
- Limited PR review guidance

### After Improvements
- **PR Review is PRIMARY GOAL** across all files
- **Clear build system hierarchy** with visual indicators
- **Concise examples** optimized for quick review
- **Comprehensive PR review templates** and checklists
- **Quick decision guides** for common scenarios

## üîç **Specific Use Cases Addressed**

### 1. **New Algorithm Implementation**
- Clear interface selection guidance (oneAPI vs DAAL)
- Build system priority order (Make ‚Üí CMake ‚Üí Bazel)
- Comprehensive validation checklist

### 2. **Build System Changes**
- Make compatibility verification (üî¥ CRITICAL)
- CMake integration validation (üü° IMPORTANT)
- Bazel development workflow (üü¢ DEVELOPMENT)

### 3. **Performance Changes**
- Production build performance validation
- Runtime algorithm performance assessment
- Cross-platform compatibility verification

### 4. **Documentation Updates**
- Technical accuracy validation
- Build system priority documentation
- Cross-reference verification

## üö® **Critical Reminders Now Emphasized**

1. **üî¥ Make compatibility is CRITICAL** - verify FIRST
2. **üü° CMake integration is IMPORTANT** - verify SECOND  
3. **üü¢ Bazel testing is DEVELOPMENT** - verify THIRD
4. **Production builds use Make** - not Bazel
5. **End-users use CMake** - ensure find_package works
6. **Development uses Bazel** - for testing and CI/CD
7. **C++17 maximum standard** - no C++20/23 features
8. **Interface consistency** - don't mix DAAL and oneAPI
9. **Cross-repository impact** - consider scikit-learn-intelex
