# Frequently Asked Questions
This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Intel(R) Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel(R) DAAL). Let us know if you have a question that is not covered here via [GitHub issues][gh-issues] or [Intel(R) DAAL Forum][daal-forum].

## Building Intel(R) DAAL from sources

The cause of this problem is absence of the path to [JNI][jni-wiki] headers in compiler's environment. It can be resolved by adding the required paths to the `CPATH` (on Linux\* and MacOS\*) or `INCLUDE` (on Windows\*) environment variable.
```
export CPATH=$JAVA_HOME/include:$JAVA_HOME/include/linux:$CPATH     # for Linux*
export CPATH=$JAVA_HOME/include:$JAVA_HOME/include/darwin:$CPATH    # for MacOS*
set INCLUDE=%JAVA_HOME%/include;%JAVA_HOME%/include/win32;%INCLUDE% # for Windows*
```

### Windows\* specific questions
> During the build process I can see errors reported by the `find` util. Any ideas on what can cause them?

It is likely caused by execution of the MSYS2* `find` command on FAT32 file system. Building Intel DAAL on NTFS should not cause these issues.

> What can cause Makefile fail with "fork: Resource temporarily unavailable" error?

This error can be caused by execution of the MSYS2* `make` util with a large number of threads. You can reduce the number of threads to solve this issue. Try using make with a smaller number of threads, e.g. `make daal -j 4 PLAT=win32e`.
