# General Repository Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Repository Context

**oneDAL** (oneAPI Data Analytics Library) is a high-performance C++ library for machine learning algorithms with dual interfaces:

- **Traditional DAAL**: Legacy CPU-focused interface for backward compatibility
- **Modern oneAPI**: GPU-accelerated interface with SYCL support for new development

**Integration Note**: oneDAL works together with the [scikit-learn-intelex](https://github.com/intel/scikit-learn-intelex) project. While they are separate repositories, they share common validation aspects and work together to provide accelerated machine learning capabilities.

## 游꿢 **PRIMARY GOAL: PR Review Assistance**

**GitHub Copilot's main purpose in this repository is to assist with PR reviews and validation.**

### 游늶 **PR Review Priority Checklist**
- [ ] **游댮 CRITICAL**: Make build compatibility (production builds)
- [ ] **游리 IMPORTANT**: CMake integration (end-user support)  
- [ ] **游릭 DEVELOPMENT**: Bazel tests (development workflow)
- [ ] **游댮 CRITICAL**: C++17 compliance maintained
- [ ] **游리 IMPORTANT**: Interface consistency preserved
- [ ] **游리 IMPORTANT**: Cross-repository impact assessed
- [ ] **游리 IMPORTANT**: Coding standards followed

## Critical Rules

### Interface Selection
- **NEW CODE**: Always use the **oneAPI interface** (`cpp/oneapi/`) for new development
- **LEGACY CODE**: Use **DAAL interface** (`cpp/daal/`) only when modifying existing code
- **NEVER MIX**: Don't mix DAAL and oneAPI interfaces in the same file

### C++ Standards
- **Language**: Use C++17 features when possible, C++14 minimum
- **Maximum Standard**: C++17 ONLY - do not use C++20/23 features for compatibility reasons
- **Headers**: Use `#pragma once` for oneAPI, traditional guards for DAAL
- **Smart Pointers**: Always use `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`
- **RAII**: Follow Resource Acquisition Is Initialization principles

### 游댮 **Build System Priority (CRITICAL FOR PR REVIEWS)**

#### **1. Make Build System (PRIMARY for Production)**
- **游댮 CRITICAL**: All changes MUST work with Make builds
- **Purpose**: Production builds and releases
- **Priority**: HIGHEST - verify Make compatibility FIRST
- **Location**: `dev/make/` directory

#### **2. CMake Build System (End-User Integration)**
- **游리 IMPORTANT**: Changes should support CMake integration
- **Purpose**: End-user projects using `find_package(oneDAL)`
- **Priority**: HIGH - verify CMake compatibility SECOND
- **Location**: `cmake/` directory

#### **3. Bazel Build System (Development Only)**
- **游릭 DEVELOPMENT**: Changes should work with Bazel for testing
- **Purpose**: Development workflow and CI/CD testing
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - verify Bazel compatibility THIRD
- **Location**: `dev/bazel/` directory

**游뚿 WHY MAKE FIRST?** Make is the production build system used for releases. CMake is for end-user integration. Bazel is for development/testing only.

### Coding Standards
- **Comprehensive Guidelines**: Follow [coding-guidelines.md](coding-guidelines.md) for all code
- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming patterns
- **Code Structure**: Follow proper declaration order and organization
- **Documentation**: Include proper comments and documentation

## Context-Aware Behavior
